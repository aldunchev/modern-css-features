## SLIDE 2: The Challenge

### Title
```
The Front-End Developer's Dilemma
```

### Content (Bullet Points)
```
🔥 100+ new CSS features added (2020-2026)

📚 Documentation scattered everywhere
    • MDN for specs
    • Can I Use for browser support
    • Blog posts for real examples
    • Stack Overflow for gotchas

⏱️ Trial-and-error takes hours per feature

💻 JavaScript alternatives still dominant
    • Many devs don't know CSS can do it now
    • Old habits from 2015 persist
```

### Visual Suggestion
- Use icons/emojis for each point
- Consider timeline graphic showing CSS evolution
- Keep background clean and readable

### Speaker Notes
> "We're in an interesting moment. CSS has evolved dramatically, but knowledge hasn't caught up. Most developers still reach for JavaScript because they don't know CSS can handle modals, carousels, animations natively now."

## SLIDE 3: The Solution

### Title
```
Claude Code: AI Pair Programmer
```

### Content (Process Flow)
```
1️⃣ RESEARCH
   Explore Agent → Finds creative examples in minutes

2️⃣ VERIFICATION
   WebSearch → Browser support for multiple features (parallel)

3️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION
   Write/Edit Tools → Generates code with explanations

4️⃣ DOCUMENTATION
   AI Documents → Writes while you build

5️⃣ VERSION CONTROL
   /commit Skill → Structured git commits
```

### Visual Suggestion
- Vertical flow diagram with arrows
- Icons for each step
- Use brand colors (blue for primary actions)

### Speaker Notes
> "Claude Code isn't just a code generator. It's a research assistant, documentation writer, and coding partner that handles the tedious parts while you make the architectural decisions."

---

## SLIDE 4: The Results

### Title
```
Real Results, Real Metrics
```

### Content (Large Numbers)
```
⏱️  2.75 HOURS
   instead of 15-22 hours

📊 87% TIME SAVINGS

🎨 5 CSS FEATURES
   Fully implemented with demos

💻 3,500+ LINES
   Code + documentation

✅ 11 INTERACTIVE DEMOS
   Production-ready examples
```

### Visual Suggestion
- Large, bold numbers
- Progress bar showing 87% savings
- Before/After comparison (22 hours → 2.75 hours)
- Use green for positive metrics

### Speaker Notes
> "These aren't theoretical numbers. The git history proves this timeline with timestamps. I'll show you the actual commits in the video walkthrough."

---

## SLIDE 5: How It Works (Workflow)

### Title
```
The 5-Phase Workflow
```

### Content (Timeline/Flow)
```
PHASE 1: Setup (15 min)
Tools: Bash, Write
→ Project structure, base files, git init

PHASE 2: Research (30 min)
Tools: Explore Agent, WebSearch (parallel)
→ Find examples, check browser support

PHASE 3: Implement (90 min)
Tools: Write/Edit, TodoWrite
→ Build features with demos

PHASE 4: Document (45 min)
Tools: AI writes its own docs
→ AI_WORKFLOW.md, FEATURES.md, README.md

PHASE 5: Commit (ongoing)
Tools: /commit skill
→ Clean git history with co-authorship
```

### Visual Suggestion
- Horizontal timeline with milestones
- Show cumulative time at each phase
- Use different colors per phase

### Speaker Notes
> "Notice the research phase is only 30 minutes for 5 features. That's where the biggest time savings come from - parallel execution and Explore Agent doing hours of reading in minutes."

## SLIDE 6: Decision Tree - When to Use What

### Title
```
Quick Reference: Which Tool for Which Task?
```

### Content (Decision Tree)
```
❓ Need examples or creative patterns?
   → Explore Agent
   Example: "Research creative demos for :has() selector"

❓ Need browser support for multiple features?
   → Parallel WebSearch
   Example: "Check support for :has(), container queries, popover API"

❓ Multi-step task with 3+ steps?
   → TodoWrite
   Tracks progress across implementation phases

❓ Creating git commits?
   → /commit skill
   Structured commits with co-authorship

❓ File operations (read, write, edit)?
   → Read/Write/Edit tools
   Direct file manipulation
```

### Visual Suggestion
- Flowchart or decision tree graphic
- Use question marks and arrows
- Color-code each tool type
- Keep text concise

### Alternative Layout (Simpler)
```
TASK                          →  TOOL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Research examples             →  Explore Agent
Check browser support         →  WebSearch (parallel)
Track multi-step tasks        →  TodoWrite
Create commits                →  /commit
Read/write files              →  Read/Write/Edit
```

### Speaker Notes
> "This is your cheat sheet. When you're stuck, ask yourself: 'Am I researching, implementing, or documenting?' Then pick the right tool. I'll give you a printed version of this after the presentation."

## BONUS SLIDE (Optional): Effective Prompts

### Title
```
Prompt Engineering: Good vs Bad
```

### Content (Two Columns)
```
✅ GOOD PROMPTS (Specific & Clear)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Research 3 creative demos for CSS :has()
selector that replace JavaScript"

"Search in parallel: browser support for
container queries, :has(), popover API"

"Create css/features/carousel.css with
scroll-snap. Add 3 examples with comments"

"Explain why this CSS pattern works
better than JavaScript"


❌ BAD PROMPTS (Vague)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Make it better"

"Fix the CSS"

"Do the thing"

"Help me with this"

"Optimize everything"
```

### Visual Suggestion
- Side-by-side comparison
- Green checkmarks for good, red X for bad
- Code-style font for prompts

### Speaker Notes
> "The quality of Claude's response depends on your prompt. Be specific about what you want, include examples, mention constraints. Think of it like delegating to a junior developer - the clearer you are, the better the result."
