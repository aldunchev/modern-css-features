# Initial Prompt: Modern CSS Features Showcase

> This is the initial request that started the project

---

I would like to build a repo as a showcase how to implement new CSS features that replace a lot of usage of JS with the usage of AI.

## Two Main Focus Areas

### 1. Proper Usage of AI
Use Claude Code wisely - whether it's best to use skills, sub-agents, slash commands, etc. Think about what is best for each task.

### 2. The CSS Features
Focus on the CSS features themselves, of course having in mind the above AI workflow.

## Initial Plan

I will provide a list with the features that I want and references to documentation. You may research if there are MCP tools for this as well.

For the design, think if we can leverage Claude Code front-end plugin skill from Anthropic. The design is not very important - the idea is to show the front-enders from my work:
- How they can implement the new CSS features that replace JS
- How this can be done with AI (Claude Code)

Links to documentation will follow up... Let's brainstorm this for now.
