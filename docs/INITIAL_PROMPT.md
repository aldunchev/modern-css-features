I would like to build a repo as a showcase how to implement new CSS features, that replace a lot of usage of JS with
the usage of AI.\
\
So I would like to focus on 2 topics:\

1. The proper usage of AI for this matter - use Claude code wisely, whether is best to use skills, sub agensts,
   slash commands, etc. utlrathink what is best\
2. The CSS features itself, of course having in mind the above.\
   \
   I will provide a list with the features that I want and references to documentation. You may research if there are
   MCP tools for this as well.\
   \
   For the design think if we can leverage claude code front-end plugin skill from Anthropic. Cause the design is not
   very important, the idea is to show the front-enders from my work how they can implement the new features that CSS
   offers to replace some of the JS we use and to show how this can be done with AI, i.e. Claude code. Links to
   documentation will follow up... Let's brainstorm this for now
